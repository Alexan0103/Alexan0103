## I'm a *self-taught* beginner frontend developer💻... <br> 
...My journey into coding began with a fascination with how websites work, a desire to create things digitally. <br> My path is just starting, but every line of code is a step toward mastery🎓 <br>
I thrive on challenges and love the process of learning — whether it’s debugging tricky JavaScript issues, optimizing CSS for smoother animations, or exploring new frameworks. Every project, big or small, is an opportunity to grow and refine my skills📈

╰┈➤ *Learning → Coding → Repeating* ↳↰ <br>
###### I believe in "learning by doing" — whether it’s through personal projects or breaking things in a controlled environment. <br> Clean code, user-centric design, and continuous improvement are what drive me forward.
